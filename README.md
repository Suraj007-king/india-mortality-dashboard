Power BI project analyzing India's mortality and life expectancy (2000â€“2015) using SQL, DAX, and visualization techniques.
 ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India Mortality Analytics and Life Expectancy Dashboard

This project presents a Power BI-based analytical dashboard that explores mortality trends across Indian states between **2000 and 2015**. The goal is to gain actionable insights related to **death rates, causes of death, life expectancy, gender-based differences, and population trends** for better public health understanding and data-driven decision-making.

 Key Features of the Dashboard

-  **National Mortality Overview**  
  - Life expectancy, death rate, total population, total deaths  
  - KPI cards, line chart, clustered bar, pie chart, and filled map

-  **State-wise Mortality Trends**  
  - Deaths over time, causes by state, literacy comparison

-  **Gender-Based Analysis**  
  - Death rate by gender, cause analysis, population-vs-death scatter plots

-  **Cause-Specific Trends**  
  - Most common death causes across age ranges, states, genders
